Python is an amazing programming language when compared to others. But some of them uses the latest version ~3.0+ or the
most stable version 2.7

I often get confused or irritated with python packagaes. Most of the packages are inter-related to the other python packages.
Sometimes, if you need to pip install a package, it will depend on an another package on particular version called "a". Now you
will install the dependent package with version "A" and everything would become normal. But in future, if you are installing
a new package which depends on the already dependent package but on higher version "B" then the real problem will start. And if,
you don't have the root access then you are literally doomed.

One easy solution to work on this is: VIRTUAL ENV
The python virtual environment will create a brand new environment that won't collide with the exisiting package at any point
of time. you can do whatever you want.

Anyone can understand from the term "Virtual env" that it is going to be an isolated one. Then why I gave such a long
info ? Just like that.

How to work on creating the virtualEnv ?

1. First install virtualenv

pip install virtualenv

2. Create a virtual env:

virtualenv testVenv

This will install a directory called "testVenv" in the location you ran the command.

2. Activating the virtual environment:

source testVenv/bin/activate

That's it!
